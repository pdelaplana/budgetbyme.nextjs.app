## Project Overview

BudgetByMe is a budgeting and expense tracking web application for life's major events (weddings, graduations, honeymoons, celebrations). Users can create events, set up budgets with expenses, track payments, and monitor spending through dashboards and charts.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4.6 with React 19.1.1
- **Build Tool**: Turbopack (stable, enabled in development)
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Forms**: React Hook Form
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **Backend Jobs**: Firebase Cloud Functions
- **Deployment**: (TBD - likely Vercel for Next.js)

## Architecture

### Core Data Models
- **Users**: Firebase Auth users with profile data in Firestore
- **Events**: Top-level containers (name, description, dates)
- **Expenses**: Budgeted items with categories, vendor info, documents
- **Payment Schedules**: Optional payment plans for expenses
- **Payments**: Actual payments made against expenses or schedules
- **Categories**: Budget categorization system

### Key Features
- Authentication flow (sign up/sign in required)
- Event creation and management
- Expense budgeting with categories and tags
- Payment scheduling (ASAP, On The Day, specific dates)
- Payment tracking with receipts
- Unplanned expense handling
- Dashboard with multiple chart views
- Data export (background jobs)
- Account deletion

### Firebase Security Rules
Implement Firestore rules ensuring users can only access their own events and related data.

## Development Commands

- `npm run dev` - Development server with Turbopack (fast builds)
- `npm run build` - Production build
- `npm run start` - Production server
- `npm run lint` - ESLint
- `npm run check` - Biome linter check
- `npm run biome:fix` - Biome auto-fix issues
- `npm run format` - Biome format code
- `npm test` - Tests (when implemented)

## Recent Updates

### Next.js 15 Upgrade (August 2025)
- **Upgraded from**: Next.js 14.0.4 + React 18 â†’ Next.js 15.4.6 + React 19.1.1
- **Turbopack**: Now stable and enabled in development (`--turbo` flag)
- **Performance**: Significantly faster development builds and HMR
- **Compatibility**: All existing components work without changes (using client components with useParams)
- **Breaking Changes Handled**: 
  - Fixed caching behavior changes
  - Updated TypeScript types for React 19
  - Corrected async params handling where needed

### PWA Implementation Plan
- **Document**: See `PWA_IMPLEMENTATION_PRD.md` for comprehensive implementation roadmap
- **Timeline**: 6-week implementation plan with 4 phases
- **Dependencies**: next-pwa, web-push for notifications
- **Features**: Offline support, installability, push notifications, background sync

## Key Implementation Notes

### Authentication Flow
All routes except auth pages should redirect unauthenticated users to sign in.

### Data Structure
```
/users/{userId}/events/{eventId}/expenses/{expenseId}
/users/{userId}/events/{eventId}/payments/{paymentId}
/users/{userId}/events/{eventId}/schedules/{scheduleId}
```

### TanStack Query Usage
- Use query hooks for data fetching (events, expenses, payments)
- Use mutation hooks for write operations (create/update/delete)
- Implement optimistic updates where appropriate

### File Uploads
Use Firebase Storage for receipts, documents, and images with proper security rules.

### Background Jobs
Firebase Cloud Functions for:
- Data export processing
- Email notifications
- Payment due alerts

### Charts Implementation
Using Recharts library for:
- Budget vs Actual gauge (implemented)
- Payment forecast line chart (implemented)
- Category breakdown pie chart (implemented)
- Quick stats dashboard (implemented)

## AI Enhancement Opportunities

### Budget Setup Assistant
- Event type detection (wedding, graduation, etc.)
- Suggested expense categories based on event type
- Cost estimation using historical data or market research
- Vendor recommendations by location and budget

### Smart Categorization
- Auto-categorize expenses based on description
- Suggest payment schedules based on vendor type
- Flag potential budget overruns

### Spending Insights
- Pattern recognition in spending behavior
- Budget optimization suggestions
- Seasonal cost variations for different event types

## UI/UX Guidelines

- Clean, minimalist design focused on clarity
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Progress indicators for multi-step processes
- Clear visual hierarchy in dashboard charts
- Accessible color palette suitable for financial data
- Intuitive navigation between events and expense management

## Development Best Practices

### Next.js 15 Considerations
- Use client components (`'use client'`) for interactive UI with useParams/useRouter
- Server components handle async params automatically (await params)
- Turbopack provides faster development experience
- React 19 features available (new hooks, concurrent features)

### Code Quality
- Biome for linting and formatting (configured)
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Consistent file structure following Next.js 15 app directory conventions

### Performance
- Turbopack for development builds (~5x faster)
- TanStack Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Optimistic updates for better UX
- Lazy loading for charts and modals
