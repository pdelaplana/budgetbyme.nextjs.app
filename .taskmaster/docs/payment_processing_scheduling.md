# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Payment Processing & Scheduling

## 1. Executive Summary
**Feature Name**: Payment Processing & Scheduling System
**Priority**: High
**Timeline**: 4-5 weeks
**Dependencies**: Expense Management System, Firebase Integration

### Problem Statement
Users need to track actual payments against their budgeted expenses, create payment schedules for large expenses, and monitor payment due dates. The current system has UI mockups but lacks the backend logic for payment tracking, schedule management, and payment status updates.

### Solution Overview
Implement a comprehensive payment management system that allows users to record payments, create payment schedules, track payment status, and receive notifications for upcoming due dates. Build React Query hooks following the established pattern and integrate with the expense management system.

- Provide payment scheduling functionality for large expenses
- Implement automatic payment status tracking and updates
- Create notification system for overdue and upcoming payments
- Establish payment history and audit trail

### Success Metrics
- 100% test coverage for payment hooks and server actions
- Payment recording accuracy: 99.9% (no data loss)
- Payment notification delivery rate > 95%
- User satisfaction with payment tracking workflow > 4.5/5
- Average time to record a payment < 30 seconds
