# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Firebase Integration & Data Persistence

## 1. Executive Summary
**Feature Name**: Firebase Integration & Data Persistence
**Priority**: High (Critical Foundation)
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Dependencies**: None (Foundation requirement)

### Problem Statement
The application currently uses mock data and lacks real database integration. Users cannot persist their data, authenticate properly, or access their information across devices. The TypeScript errors in Firestore types need resolution, and the authentication flow requires completion.

### Solution Overview
Implement complete Firebase integration including Authentication, Firestore database with proper security rules, Firebase Storage for file uploads, and replace all mock data with real persistence. Fix existing TypeScript errors and establish the foundation for all other features.

## 2. Objectives & Success Metrics

### Primary Objectives
- Replace all mock data with real Firestore persistence
- Implement complete Firebase Authentication flow
- Establish secure Firestore security rules
- Set up Firebase Storage with proper CORS configuration
- Fix all TypeScript errors in Firestore type definitions

### Success Metrics
- Zero TypeScript compilation errors
- 100% of CRUD operations use real Firebase (no mock data)
- Authentication success rate > 99%
- Database security rules pass security testing
- File upload success rate > 95%

## 3. User Stories & Requirements

### Database Schema Implementation
```
/users/{userId}
{
  id: string,
  email: string,
  displayName: string,
  photoURL?: string,
  defaultCurrency: string,
  _createdDate: Date,
  _lastSignIn: Date
}

/users/{userId}/events/{eventId}
{
  // Event schema as defined in event management system
}

/users/{userId}/events/{eventId}/expenses/{expenseId}
{
  // Expense schema for future implementation
}

/users/{userId}/events/{eventId}/categories/{categoryId}
{
  // Category schema for future implementation
}
```

### Security Rules
```javascript
// Firestore Security Rules
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only access their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      
      // Users can access their own events and sub-collections
      match /{path=**} {
        allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      }
    }
  }
}

// Storage Security Rules
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /users/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

## 5. UI/UX Specifications

### Key User Flows
1. **First-time Registration**: Landing → Sign Up → Email Verification → Welcome → Dashboard
2. **Returning User Login**: Landing → Sign In → Dashboard
3. **Session Management**: Auto-login → Dashboard OR Session Expired → Sign In

### Authentication UI Components
- Sign-in form with email/password and Google OAuth
- Sign-up form with email verification flow
- Password reset form with email confirmation
- User profile menu with sign-out option
- Loading spinners for authentication states

### Mobile Considerations
- Touch-friendly authentication forms
- Biometric authentication support (future enhancement)
- Offline data access with sync indicators
- Mobile-optimized file upload flows

- Security tests: Firestore rules validation

## 7. Security & Privacy

### Security Requirements
- Strong password requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers)
- Email verification required for account activation
- Firestore security rules prevent cross-user data access
- Firebase Storage rules restrict file access to owners
- Server-side authentication verification for sensitive operations

### Privacy Considerations

- No personal information is logged in error messages
- GDPR-compliant data deletion upon account removal
- User consent for data collection and processing
- Secure session management with proper expiration

## 8. Performance Requirements

### Performance Targets
- Authentication response time < 2s
- Firestore query response time < 500ms
- File upload progress feedback within 100ms
- Real-time updates propagate within 3s
- App initialization time < 3s

### Scalability Considerations
- Efficient Firestore query patterns to minimize reads
- Connection pooling for Firebase Admin SDK
- Proper indexing for common query patterns
- Firestore offline persistence for better mobile experience

## 9. Dependencies & Risks
