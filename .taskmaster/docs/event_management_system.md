- Enhance event creation and editing UI components
- Implement event sharing and collaboration features
- Add event templates based on event types
- Ensure seamless integration with expense and payment systems

### Success Metrics
- Maintain 100% test coverage (currently 79 tests passing ‚úÖ)
- Event creation success rate > 99.9%
- Event data persistence across sessions: 100%
- Average time to create an event < 2 minutes
- User satisfaction with event management workflow > 4.5/5
