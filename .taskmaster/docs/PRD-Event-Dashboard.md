# Product Requirements Document: Event Dashboard

## Overview

The Event Dashboard is the primary interface for users to monitor and manage their event budgets. It provides a comprehensive view of financial health, spending patterns, and key metrics for a specific event.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement
Users need a centralized view to understand their event's financial status at a glance, including budget utilization, expense breakdowns, and payment timelines. Without this dashboard, users would need to navigate multiple sections to piece together their event's financial picture.

### Success Metrics
- Users spend at least 3 minutes on the dashboard per session
- 90% of users can identify their budget status within 10 seconds
- Dashboard loading time under 2 seconds
- Users access dashboard at least 3 times per week during active event planning

## User Stories

### Primary Users
- **Event Planners**: Individuals planning personal events (weddings, graduations, parties)
- **Budget Managers**: Users responsible for tracking expenses and payments

### Core User Stories

**As an event planner, I want to:**
1. See my total budget vs actual spending at a glance
2. View upcoming payment due dates to avoid late fees
3. Understand which expense categories are over/under budget
4. Track my payment progress toward vendors
5. Identify unplanned expenses that exceeded my buffer

**As a budget manager, I want to:**
1. Export dashboard data for external reporting
2. Compare actual vs planned spending trends over time
3. Set budget alerts when approaching limits
4. View vendor payment status to manage cash flow

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Components
- **Budget Overview Card**: Gauge chart showing total spent vs budget
- **Category Breakdown**: Pie chart of expenses by category
- **Payment Timeline**: Line chart showing payment forecast
- **Recent Activity Feed**: List of latest expenses and payments
- **Quick Actions Panel**: Add expense, record payment, export data buttons

### Data Requirements
- Real-time budget calculations
- Expense aggregation by category and date
- Payment schedule projections
- Spending trend analysis (daily/weekly/monthly)

### Performance Requirements
- Dashboard loads within 2 seconds
- Charts render within 1 second
- Real-time updates when data changes
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop

## User Interface Design

### Layout Structure
```

### External Systems
- Firebase Firestore for data persistence
- Chart.js/Recharts for visualizations
- TanStack Query for data fetching and caching

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Chart data transformation functions
- Budget calculation logic
- Date formatting utilities
- Component rendering with mock data

### Integration Tests
- Dashboard loads with real data
- Chart updates when data changes
- Navigation between dashboard sections
- Responsive design across devices

### User Acceptance Tests
