# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Expense Management System

## 1. Executive Summary
**Feature Name**: Expense Management System
**Priority**: High
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
**Dependencies**: Event Management System (✅ Complete), Firebase Integration

### Problem Statement
Users need a comprehensive system to create, categorize, track, and manage expenses for their events. Currently, the app has mock data and UI components but lacks the complete backend integration and React Query hooks for expense operations.

### Solution Overview
Implement a complete expense management system following the established event management pattern, with React Query hooks, server actions, comprehensive testing, and real Firebase integration.

## 2. Objectives & Success Metrics

### Primary Objectives
- Enable users to create, read, update, and delete expenses for their events
- Provide categorization and tagging capabilities for expense organization
- Implement file upload functionality for receipts and documents
- Ensure real-time synchronization across devices using React Query

### Success Metrics
- 100% test coverage for expense hooks (matching event system's 79 tests)
- API response times < 500ms for expense operations
- Successful file upload rate > 95%
- Zero data loss during CRUD operations

## 3. User Stories & Requirements

  id: string,
  name: string,
  amount: number,
  currency: string,
  categoryId: string,
  vendorName?: string,
  description?: string,

  attachments: string[], // Firebase Storage URLs
  paymentStatus: 'pending' | 'partial' | 'paid',
  tags: string[],
  _createdDate: Date,
  _createdBy: string,
  _updatedDate: Date,
  _updatedBy: string
}

/users/{userId}/events/{eventId}/categories/{categoryId}
{
  id: string,

  color: string,
  icon: string,
  description?: string,
  _createdDate: Date,
  _createdBy: string,
  _updatedDate: Date,
  _updatedBy: string
}
```

### API Endpoints
```
Server Actions:
- addExpense(userId: string, eventId: string, expenseDto: AddExpenseDTO)
- fetchExpenses(userId: string, eventId: string, filters?: ExpenseFilters)
- fetchExpense(userId: string, eventId: string, expenseId: string)
- updateExpense(userId: string, eventId: string, expenseId: string, updates: UpdateExpenseDTO)

```

## 5. UI/UX Specifications

### Key User Flows
1. **Add Expense Flow**: Dashboard → Add Expense Button → Form → File Upload → Success → Expense List
2. **Edit Expense Flow**: Expense List → Edit Button → Form → Save → Updated List
3. **Category Management Flow**: Settings → Categories → Add/Edit/Delete → Budget Allocation

### Wireframes/Mockups
- Expense list with card-based layout showing amount, category, and status
- Add/Edit expense modal with tabbed sections (Details, Files, Payment)
- Category management interface with budget progress bars
- File upload area with preview and validation feedback

### Mobile Considerations
- Touch-friendly file upload with camera integration
- Swipe gestures for quick actions (edit, delete)
- Responsive category selection with visual icons
- Optimized form layout for mobile screens

### State Management
- React Query for server state with automatic caching and invalidation
- Local form state with React Hook Form
- File upload state with progress tracking
- Optimistic updates for better UX

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests: 90%+ coverage for all hooks and server actions
- Integration tests: Complete CRUD workflows
- E2E tests: Critical user flows from creation to deletion

## 7. Security & Privacy

### Security Requirements
- Input validation and sanitization for all expense data
- File upload security: type validation, size limits, virus scanning
- Firestore security rules to prevent unauthorized access
- Audit trail for all expense modifications

### Privacy Considerations
- Expense data is private to the user and event participants
- File attachments are stored securely in Firebase Storage
- Data encryption in transit and at rest
- GDPR compliance for data deletion

## 8. Performance Requirements

### Performance Targets
- Expense list load time < 1s for 100 expenses
- File upload progress feedback within 100ms
- Real-time updates propagate within 2s
- Offline support with sync when reconnected

### Scalability Considerations
- Pagination for large expense lists (50 items per page)
- Image compression for uploaded receipts
- Lazy loading for expense details
- Efficient query patterns to minimize Firestore reads

## 9. Dependencies & Risks

### Technical Dependencies
- Event Management System (✅ Complete)
- Firebase Authentication integration
- Firebase Storage setup and CORS configuration
- React Query DevTools for debugging

### External Dependencies
- Firebase Firestore for data persistence
- Firebase Storage for file uploads
- Biome for code quality and testing

### Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| File upload failures | High | Medium | Implement retry logic and fallback UI |
| Large expense lists slow performance | Medium | High | Implement pagination and virtual scrolling |
| Firestore quota limits | High | Low | Monitor usage and implement caching |
| Complex category relationships | Medium | Medium | Start with simple flat structure |

- [ ] Create expense TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Implement server actions with validation
- [ ] Build React Query hooks following event pattern
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage (target: 25+ tests)
- [ ] Update Firestore security rules

### Phase 2: Category Management (Week 2-3)
- [ ] Implement category CRUD operations
- [ ] Add budget allocation and tracking

- [ ] Add mobile-responsive design

## 11. Testing & Validation

### Test Cases
1. **Expense Creation**
   - Given: User is on event dashboard
   - When: User creates expense with valid data
   - Then: Expense is saved and appears in list

2. **File Upload**
   - Given: User is creating an expense
   - When: User uploads a receipt file
   - Then: File is uploaded to storage and linked to expense

3. **Category Budget Tracking**
   - Given: Category has a $1000 budget
   - When: Expenses totaling $1200 are added
   - Then: Overspend warning is displayed

### User Acceptance Testing
- Create 10 expenses across 3 categories without errors
- Upload 5 different file types (PDF, JPG, PNG) successfully
- Edit expense details and verify changes persist
- Delete expenses and confirm they're removed from budget calculations

## 12. Launch Strategy

### Success Monitoring
- Track expense creation/edit/delete success rates
- Monitor file upload success and failure rates
- Measure page load times and user engagement
- Alert on Firestore quota usage

### Rollback Plan
