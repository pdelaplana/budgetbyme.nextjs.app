# File Rename: photoStorage.ts ‚Üí uploadPhoto.ts

## Summary
Successfully renamed the photo storage server actions file to match the primary action name for better consistency and clarity.

## Changes Made

### üìÅ **File Rename**
- **From**: `src/server/actions/photoStorage.ts`
- **To**: `src/server/actions/uploadPhoto.ts`

### üîó **Import Path Updates**
Updated import statements in:
- `src/lib/photo-upload-utils.ts`

```typescript
// Before
import { uploadPhoto, uploadPhotoBlob, removePhoto } from '@/server/actions/photoStorage';

// After
import { uploadPhoto, uploadPhotoBlob, removePhoto } from '@/server/actions/uploadPhoto';
```

### üìã **Documentation Updates**
Updated references in:
- `docs/PHOTO_ACTIONS_REFACTORING.md`
- `docs/FIREBASE_STORAGE_CORS_SOLUTIONS.md`
- `docs/PROFILE_PHOTO_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

## Rationale

### ‚úÖ **Better Naming Convention**
- File name now matches the primary action `uploadPhoto`
- More descriptive and action-oriented naming
- Follows the pattern of other server action files

### ‚úÖ **Improved Clarity**
- Immediately clear what the primary purpose of the file is
- Easier to locate upload-related functionality
- Consistent with action-based naming patterns

## File Structure After Rename

```
src/server/actions/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ uploadPhoto.ts           # Photo upload, blob upload, and removal actions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ setupUserWorkspace.ts    # User workspace setup
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ fetchUserWorkspace.ts    # User workspace fetching
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ testAction.ts           # Test server action
```

## Verification

### ‚úÖ **Compilation Check**
- [x] No TypeScript compilation errors
- [x] All imports resolve correctly
- [x] Server actions function properly

### ‚úÖ **Import Updates**
- [x] photo-upload-utils.ts imports updated
- [x] No broken import references
- [x] All function exports work correctly

### ‚úÖ **Documentation**
- [x] All documentation files updated
- [x] No references to old file name remain
- [x] Examples and code snippets corrected

## Impact Assessment

### üü¢ **Zero Breaking Changes**
- Same exported functions (`uploadPhoto`, `uploadPhotoBlob`, `removePhoto`)
- Same function signatures and return types
- Same Sentry monitoring and error handling
- Only import path changed

### üü¢ **Improved Developer Experience**
- More intuitive file name
- Easier to find upload-related functionality
- Consistent with naming conventions
- Better code organization

## Files Affected

### Updated Files:
1. `src/lib/photo-upload-utils.ts` - Import path updated
2. `docs/PHOTO_ACTIONS_REFACTORING.md` - File references updated
3. `docs/FIREBASE_STORAGE_CORS_SOLUTIONS.md` - Path references updated
4. `docs/PROFILE_PHOTO_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Server actions location updated

### Removed Files:
1. `src/server/actions/photoStorage.ts` - Replaced by uploadPhoto.ts

### New Files:
1. `src/server/actions/uploadPhoto.ts` - Renamed from photoStorage.ts

## Future Considerations

### ‚úÖ **Naming Consistency**
- Consider this pattern for other server action files
- Use action-based naming for better clarity
- Primary action name as file name when applicable

### ‚úÖ **File Organization**
- Current structure works well for the number of actions
- Consider grouping by domain (auth, photos, workspace) if actions grow
- Maintain clear, descriptive file names
