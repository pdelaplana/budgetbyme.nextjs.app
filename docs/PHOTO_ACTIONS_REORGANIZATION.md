# Photo Server Actions Reorganization

## 📁 New Structure

The photo server actions have been reorganized from a single monolithic file into a clean, modular structure:

```
src/server/actions/photos/
├── index.ts              # Central exports and type definitions
├── uploadPhoto.ts        # File upload server action
├── uploadPhotoBlob.ts    # Blob upload server action (camera)
└── removePhoto.ts        # Photo removal server action
```

## 🔄 Migration Summary

### **Before** (Monolithic):
```typescript
// Single file: src/server/actions/uploadPhoto.ts
export const uploadPhoto = withSentryServerAction(...)
export const uploadPhotoBlob = withSentryServerAction(...)
export const removePhoto = withSentryServerAction(...)
```

### **After** (Modular):
```typescript
// src/server/actions/photos/index.ts
export { uploadPhoto } from './uploadPhoto';
export { uploadPhotoBlob } from './uploadPhotoBlob';
export { removePhoto } from './removePhoto';
```

## 📋 File Details

### **1. `uploadPhoto.ts`**
- **Purpose**: Handles File object uploads (from file inputs)
- **Features**: File validation, type checking, size limits
- **Use Case**: Traditional file upload forms

### **2. `uploadPhotoBlob.ts`**
- **Purpose**: Handles Blob uploads (from camera captures)
- **Features**: Enhanced logging, blob processing, camera optimization
- **Use Case**: Camera captures, canvas exports

### **3. `removePhoto.ts`**
- **Purpose**: Handles photo deletion from Firebase Storage
- **Features**: Smart URL parsing, path extraction, comprehensive error handling
- **Use Case**: Photo removal, profile cleanup

### **4. `index.ts`**
- **Purpose**: Central exports and type definitions
- **Features**: Clean imports, TypeScript types, documentation
- **Exports**: All photo actions and result types

## 🚀 Benefits

### **1. Better Organization**
- ✅ Separated concerns - each file has single responsibility
- ✅ Easier to locate specific functionality
- ✅ Clear module boundaries

### **2. Improved Maintainability**
- ✅ Smaller, focused files (~100 lines each vs 341 lines)
- ✅ Easier to test individual functions
- ✅ Reduced merge conflicts

### **3. Enhanced Developer Experience**
- ✅ Better IDE navigation and search
- ✅ Cleaner imports: `from '@/server/actions/photos'`
- ✅ Type safety with exported interfaces

### **4. Scalability**
- ✅ Easy to add new photo-related actions
- ✅ Clear patterns for future server actions
- ✅ Modular architecture ready for growth

## 📦 Import Changes

### **Updated Import Statement**:
```typescript
// Before
import { uploadPhoto, uploadPhotoBlob, removePhoto } from '@/server/actions/uploadPhoto';

// After
import { uploadPhoto, uploadPhotoBlob, removePhoto } from '@/server/actions/photos';
```

### **Available Exports**:
```typescript
// Server Actions
export { uploadPhoto } from './uploadPhoto';
export { uploadPhotoBlob } from './uploadPhotoBlob';
export { removePhoto } from './removePhoto';

// Type Definitions
export interface PhotoUploadResult {
  success: boolean;
  url?: string;
  error?: string;
}

export interface PhotoRemovalResult {
  success: boolean;
  error?: string;
}
```

## ✅ Verification

- **✅ All files compile without errors**
- **✅ Development server starts successfully**
- **✅ Import paths updated in consuming files**
- **✅ Existing functionality preserved**
- **✅ Type safety maintained**

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test photo upload functionality** to ensure no regressions
2. **Update documentation** to reflect new import paths
3. **Consider similar reorganization** for other server action modules
4. **Add unit tests** for individual action files

The reorganization is complete and ready for use! 🎉
