# Forgot Password Modal to Page Conversion

## Overview

Convert the existing "Forgot Password" modal implementation to a dedicated page to improve user experience, accessibility, and mobile usability based on UI/UX designer recommendations.

## Current Implementation Analysis

### Existing Components
- **File**: `src/components/modals/ForgotPasswordModal.tsx`
- **Integration**: `src/app/(auth)/signin/page.tsx:243-246`
- **Functionality**: Complete modal with form, success state, error handling

### Current Flow
1. User clicks "Forgot your password?" link on sign-in page
2. Modal opens with email input form
3. User submits email → Firebase `resetPassword()` called
4. Success state shows with confirmation and resend option
5. User closes modal to return to sign-in

### Current Features
✅ Email validation with React Hook Form
✅ Firebase integration with `resetPassword()`
✅ Loading states with spinner
✅ Error handling with Firebase error messages
✅ Success state with confirmation message
✅ Resend functionality (placeholder)
✅ Responsive modal design

## Specification

### New Implementation Requirements

#### 1. Page Structure
- **Route**: `/forgot-password`
- **Location**: `src/app/(auth)/forgot-password/page.tsx`
- **Layout**: Uses existing auth layout with consistent branding

#### 2. UI/UX Requirements

**Design Principles (from UX Designer):**
- Clean, minimalist design focused on clarity
- Mobile-first responsive approach
- Clear visual hierarchy
- Accessible color palette suitable for financial data
- Consistent with sign-in page styling

**Layout Structure:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ [← Back to Sign In]             │
│                                 │
│        Reset Your Password      │
│    Enter your email address     │
│    and we'll send you a link    │
│                                 │
│  ┌─────────────────────────┐    │
│  │ Email address           │    │
│  │ [input field]           │    │
│  └─────────────────────────┘    │
│                                 │
│  [Send Reset Link]              │
│                                 │
│  Return to sign in              │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 3. Functional Requirements

**Core Features:**
- Preserve all existing modal functionality
- Form validation identical to current implementation
- Firebase integration unchanged
- Loading states and error handling maintained
- Success state handling

**Navigation:**
- Clear "Back to Sign In" link/button in header
- After successful submission, redirect to confirmation page or show success state
- "Return to sign in" link after success

**States:**
1. **Initial Form State**: Email input with validation
2. **Loading State**: Spinner during email submission
3. **Success State**: Confirmation message with next steps
4. **Error State**: Display Firebase error messages

#### 4. Technical Requirements

**File Structure:**
```
src/app/(auth)/forgot-password/
├── page.tsx                 # Main forgot password page
└── success/
    └── page.tsx            # Optional: Dedicated success page
```

**Dependencies:**
- React Hook Form (existing)
- Firebase Auth (existing)
- Heroicons (existing)
- AuthContext (existing)

#### 5. Accessibility Requirements

**WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance:**
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy (h1 for main title)
- [ ] Form labels explicitly associated with inputs
- [ ] Focus management when page loads
- [ ] High contrast ratios (4.5:1 minimum)
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Screen reader friendly error messages
- [ ] Skip links if applicable

**Form Accessibility:**
- Proper `htmlFor` and `id` associations
- ARIA attributes for error states
- Descriptive error messages
- Clear form instructions

#### 6. Responsive Design Requirements

**Mobile (320px - 768px):**
- Full-width form with adequate touch targets
- Minimum 44px height for interactive elements
- Prominent submit button
- Simplified navigation
- Single-column layout

**Desktop (768px+):**
- Centered layout with breathing room (max-width ~400px)
- Consistent spacing with sign-in page
- Two-column button layout where appropriate

#### 7. Content Requirements

**Messaging:**
- **Primary heading**: "Reset Your Password"
- **Subheading**: "Enter your email address and we'll send you a link to reset your password"
- **Success message**: "If this email is in our system, you'll receive reset instructions"
- **Error handling**: Use existing Firebase error message utility

**Security Considerations:**
- Don't reveal whether email exists in system
- Use generic success message for security
- Maintain existing Firebase security patterns
